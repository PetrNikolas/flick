## Project Setup
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec hanami db prepare`
4. Run `bundle exec hanami server`
5. Visit --> [http://localhost:2300/](http://localhost:2300/). That's it!.

## GraphQL API playground
* Open `http://localhost:5000/graphiql` and play with GraphQL.

## Tools
* Run `rubocop` for Ruby lint.
* Run `rubocop -a` for fixed some issues automatically.
* Run `reek .` for analyzing code.
* Run `fasterer` for code analyzer.
* Run `bundle audit` for audito your bundle.
* Run `brakeman` for static analysis and for security vulnerabilities.
* Run `rails_best_practices .` in root app directory. Helps to find unused methods, missing indexes into database tables and many other things.

## Deployment
* Mainly for Heroku hosting.
* See [documentation](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Gitlab CI
* You need configure `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with your Heroku credentials.

### Travis CI
* You need configure `.travis.yml` file with your Travis and Heroku credentials.

## Docker
* Basic configuration of Docker image is in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files in root of project.

### Docker Compose useful commands
```shell
# Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service:
$ docker-compose up

# Lists containers:
$ docker-compose ps

# Managing containers lifecycle:
$ docker-compose [start|stop|kill|restart|pause|unpause|rm] SERVICE

# Displays log output from services.:
$ docker-compose logs [SERVICE...]

# Run arbitrary commands in your services:
$ docker-compose exec SERVICE COMMAND

# Runs a one-time command against a service.:
$ docker-compose run SERVICE [COMMAND]

# Rebuilding a Docker Image:
$ docker-compose build [SERVICE...]
```

## Pry initializer
Avoid repeating yourself, use pry-rails instead of copying the initializer to every rails project.
* Run `rails console` and in Rails console:
* For showing models --> `show-models`.
* For showing routes --> `show-routes`.

## Test API with Postman
### GraphQL
```shell
headers: "accept: application/json", "Authorization: token='OllBS57MeAW041dgR7xolpZaiO87kjnMVVK3qrtgtTbcBolB7K3TugZBuM6'"
method: POST

# Get all News
url: `/api/v1/graphql?query={allNews{id, title, content, description, errors}}`

# Get specific News 
url: `/api/v1/graphql?query={news(id:1){id, title, content, description, errors}}`
```

### REST
```shell
headers: "accept: application/json", "Authorization: token='OllBS57MeAW041dgR7xolpZaiO87kjnMVVK3qrtgtTbcBolB7K3TugZBuM6'"

# Get all News
url: `/api/v1/news`
method: GET

# Get specific News 
url: `/api/v1/news/:id`
method: GET

# Create News
url: `/api/v1/news`
